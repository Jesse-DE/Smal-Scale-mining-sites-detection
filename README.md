# Smal-Scale-mining-sites-detection
In this work I trained the FCN model to build an application which automatically detect Small-Scale Mines on the satellite image. We trained the model for two classes only. The tiles used came from a Sentinel satellite image acquired in 2020. 
Note that the model performance has faced the problem of imbalanced data. In comming projects we will deal with problem of imbalanced data.

The data used can be accessed upon request.
